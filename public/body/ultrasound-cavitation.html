                    <p>Ultrasound Cavitation is a non-surgical method of fat reduction. In a study conducted by Jasminka et al. (2010), it was discovered that Ultrasound Cavitation technology could reduce the thickness of the subcutaneous fat layer</p>
                    <p>During Ultrasound Cavitation, sound waves are emitted. These sound waves cause the fat cells to vibrate, and due to their weak structure, the fat cells implode. As a result of this, solid fat is turned into liquid fat, and triglycerides are converted into fatty acids and glycerol.</p>
                    <p>The body recognizes the liquid fat as a waste product and removes it from the body through the lymphatic system. There is a chance that the remaining fat cells will reabsorb the liquid fat before it leaves the body. This is why we recommend a course of treatments that are relatively close together, increasing the reduction of fat and leading to more effective results. You may feel a buzzing sensation during the treatment</p>

						<h3 id="prep-heading">24 hours pre-treatment:</h3>
						<p id="prep-desc">Maintaining a low calorie, low carbohydrate, low fat, and low sugar diet for 24 hours pre-treatment and three days post-treatment will help achieve the best results. This ensures your body utilizes the triglycerides ( a type of body fat) released by the fat cavitation process. If suitable, I also encourage my clients to stick to this diet as much as they can. Many find this to be a great starting point for maintaining a healthier lifestyle in the future.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3 id="prep-heading">Immediately after treatment:</h3>
						<p id="prep-desc">- Maintain a healthy and active lifestyle to achieve long lasting
							results. You should also ensure that you drink around 2.5 litres of water for 14 days, as this will assist the flow of the lymphatic system, helping to get rid of the broken down fat cells.<br>
							<br>- Avoid the consumption of alcohol for at least 3 days after the treatment. This is because your liver will priorities the breakdown of alcohol over the removal of dead fat cells.
							<br><br>- Apply HD Thermal Sculpt Cream to the area at least once a day after the treatment..</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<!-- <h3 id="prep-heading">2 weeks prior to treatment:</h3> -->
						<p id="prep-desc">You may notice immediate visible inch loss after your treatment.  The results continue as the body continues to get rid of fat over the next 5 days.

							We recommend a course of 6-8 treatments to get more dramatic results.  It is important that your expectations are realistic.
							
							We are reluctant to give one off treatments as results (1-3cm loss) will not be as noticeable.  Therefore, in the interest of client satisfaction, we recommend that you have 6-8 treatments.
							
							The results you see on the gallery page are real clients with real results.  We are results driven and strive to help you get the body you want.</p>

The only side effects may be that you feel a little thirsty as the body wants to flush these waste products from the body.  So drink 2 litres of water a day for 5-7 days after treatment.
