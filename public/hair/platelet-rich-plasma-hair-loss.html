                    <p>Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a medical treatment that uses the patient’s own blood plasma to address hair loss. PRP treatment involves four steps.<br> <br> 

                       <br> 1- Blood is drawn and put in a centrifuge machine to separate the different phases according to their densities.<br> 
                        
                       <br> 2- The centrifuge process is complete blood will be separated into three phases: platelet-rich plasma, platelet-poor plasma, and red blood cells.<br> 
                        
                       <br> 3- Only the platelet-rich plasma is extracted from the other two phases with the help of a syringe.<br> 
                        
                       <br> 4- Extracted platelet-rich plasma is injected into the scalp to promote hair growth.<br> 
                        
                       <br> <br> Each injection takes approximately 15 seconds. PRP treatment for hair loss is a quick and easy process that provides ultimate patient comfort. </p>

						<p id="prep-desc">Consultation: Schedule a consultation at LMAR Clinic to discuss your hair loss concerns. Our experts will evaluate your condition and determine if PRP is a suitable treatment option for you. <br>
                           <br> Medical History: During the consultation, provide details about your medical history, including any underlying conditions or medications you are currently taking. This information helps us customize the treatment plan to suit your specific needs. <br>
                            <br> Scalp Examination: Our healthcare professionals will conduct a thorough examination of your scalp to assess the extent of hair loss and determine the appropriate treatment approach.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p id="prep-desc">Avoiding Certain Activities: Following the PRP treatment, it's recommended to avoid activities that may irritate or damage the scalp, such as excessive sweating, exposure to direct sunlight, or using harsh hair products. <br>
                           <br> Gentle Hair Care: Treat your hair and scalp gently during the recovery period. Avoid vigorous brushing, tight hairstyles, and the use of heat styling tools that can further damage the hair.<br>
                           <br> Follow Instructions: Adhere to the aftercare instructions provided by our healthcare professionals, which may include using specific hair care products or medications to enhance the healing process.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p id="prep-desc">Consistency: Multiple PRP sessions are usually required for optimal results. Stick to the treatment schedule recommended by our healthcare professionals to achieve the desired outcomes. <br>
                           <br> Patience: Hair regrowth takes time, and the results of PRP treatments may not be immediate. It's important to be patient and continue with the treatment plan as advised by our experts. <br>
                           <br> Combination Therapy: In some cases, combining PRP with other hair loss treatments, such as topical medications or low-level laser therapy, may enhance the overall effectiveness. Our healthcare professionals can discuss these options with you based on your specific situation.</p>

                        <div id="answer-one" class="hidden"><p>PRP can be a good choice to stop hair loss and strengthen thinning hair thanks to its rich content of growth factors, proteins, and thrombocytes. Various studies show that PRP promotes natural hair growth and increases hair thickness by increasing the blood flow to the hair follicle. Since PRP is rich in proteins and vitamins, it is also considered to be a suitable solution for hair loss caused by nutritional deficiencies.</p></div>

                        <div id="answer-two" class="hidden"><p>People who are suffering from thinned hair and moderate hair loss are good candidates for this treatment. Also, people who are looking to enhance the results of a hair transplant can consider a PRP hair treatment for improved hair follicle health. People who are intimidated by the idea of hair transplant surgery can choose to get a PRP hair treatment to stop or slow down hair loss.
                            The use of blood thinners, heavy smoking, and certain disorders might be an obstacle for PRP hair treatment. You can contact our medical consultants for a detailed consultation.</p></div>
