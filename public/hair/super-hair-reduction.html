                    <p>SHR stands for Super Hair Removal and it is the latest breakthrough innovation in Permanent Hair Reduction. When compared to traditional or Laser hair removal treatments, SHR is faster, easier and best of all – its virtually painless.</p>

                    <p>With SHR you can experience comfortable hair reduction treatments in almost half the time of traditional laser or tougher hair removal method sessions.</p>

                    <p>The gradual heating method of the SHR light delivery to the targeted hair follicle also means that treatments are comfortable and practically pain free. This allows our specially trained clinicians here at Beautiful Body Skin Clinic to achieve exceptional hair removal results on a broader range of skin and hair types.</p>

                            Shave your hair one day before your appointment<br><br>

                            Make sure your skin is intact without contagious skin conditions (such as herpes, or cold sore)</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p id="prep-desc">It’s important that you do not pluck or wax any hair on the area that was treated. By doing so, you will disrupt the treatment process which may lead to potential stimulation of the hair follicle, in other words you could potentially spark regrowth.

                            Exfoliate the area once any redness subsides. <br><br><strong>Approximately one to two weeks after your laser hair removal appointment:</strong><br><br>
                            
                            Avoid extremely hot showers or baths for at least 48 hours after the treatment.<br><br>
                            
                            Avoid wearing tight clothings for the first 3 days<br><br></p>

						<p id="prep-desc">Hair growth occurs in 4 stages: Early Anagen (early hair growth), Anagen (active hair growth), Catagen (regression) and Telogen (resting, not growing). Laser hair removal only affects the Anagen stage (actively growing hair). Therefore, approximately twenty-five-percent of hair is removed with each treatment. A few treatments are therefore required for the treatment area to be hair free.</p>
